Tasks to perform:

Consider adding a routine to set cookies and possibly other common
headers. Perhaps put such optional extras into a separate module.
Decide whether to tighten validation of cookie names.
Decide on the appropriate action to take when presented with multiple
cookies with the same name and document it.

Test suite improvements:

Ensure test suite runs silently on
MSWin32: re test 'No request method specified, hash returned'
gives: Can't do inplace edit: / is not a regular file

Fix test failure: unreadable/unwriteable set_directory tests. See eg:
http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/af7060d8-6bf6-1014-b7cd-81111fb0de68
Perhaps it may be because MSWin32 does not have concept of read/write
perms on directories?
