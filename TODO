Tasks to perform:

Create a legacy branch which will be 2.x and maintain backwards
compatibility.
Start a 3.x branch (trunk, really) which will be a code clean-up and
removal of deprecated features. It will require at least 5.6.0 (for
lexical filehandles)
Consider adding a routine to set cookies.
Decide whether to tighten validation of cookie names.
Decide on the appropriate action to take when presented with multiple
cookies with the same name and document it.

Write tests for:
	EOL processing for the different mime types
	Fix the upload bug (RT 99294)
	create_variables (no, just deprecate this one)

Below is Smyler's todo list from 2003.

================================================================================

The list at the bottom is what I found in this TODO file when I took over this
module in 2003 August, presumably dating from 2000 or earlier.  I haven't yet
decided whether I will actually do any of these things.

Before making any changes to the functionality of CGI::Lite, I want to get the
distribution into better shape.  This include clarifying the licence and
creating some tests.  I'm also thinking updating it to use Module::Build for
creating the distribution.

Any changes I make will have tickets opened for them in CPAN Request Tracker,
where comments can be made:

  http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=CGI-Lite

And of course all users are welcome to submit feature requests and bug reports
through this interface.

Smylers

* Saving and re-loading form data
* Convenient way to output HTTP headers (including cookies)
* Creating HTML tables from arrays
* Support for ISINDEX. Does anyone still use this?
