CGI::Lite v2.99_02
------------------

Released: 4th Apr 2015

This is a developer release. It is the second pre-release leading to the
new 3.0 branch. Please be aware of the API changes and report any bug
no matter how small or insignificant. Your assistance is greatly
appreciated.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has no dependencies and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

Added force_unique_cookies method and equivalent parsing code and tests.

Improved test suite: better coverage, skipped failling tests for
Microsoft systems which don't use/honour normal permissions, silenced
noisy tests on older perls.

See the CHANGES file for full history.
