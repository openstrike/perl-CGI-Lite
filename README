CGI::Lite v2.99_01
----------------

Released: 31st Mar 2015

This is a developer release. It is the first pre-release leading to the
new 3.0 branch. Please be aware of the API changes and report any bug
no matter how small or insignificant. Your assistance is greatly
appreciated.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has no dependencies and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

Source amended to pass perlcritic. String evals removed or replaced.
Strictures added to module and examples. All filehandles are now
lexicals. Consistent source formatting applied to module (perltidy).

deny_uploads and set_size_limit added.

All active public subroutines are now methods.

print_cookie_data and print_form_data have been removed. They had been
deprecated for well over a decade.

escape_dangerous_chars has been removed. It has been considered a
security risk since version 2.0.
