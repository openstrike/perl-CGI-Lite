CGI::Lite v3.00
---------------

Released: 21st May 2015

This is the first public release of the
new 3.0 branch. Please be aware of the API changes with particular
reference to the deprecated and obsolete subroutines and methods.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has no dependencies and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

These are the changes since the last public release (2.05).

Uploaded files with duplicate field names are treated in the
same ways as other data with duplicate field names.

BUG FIX: Additional change to forms.t to prevent MS Windows systems
    hanging. (issue 103315)

Added force_unique_cookies method and equivalent parsing code and tests.

Improved test suite: better coverage, skipped failling tests for
Microsoft systems which don't use/honour normal permissions, silenced
noisy tests on older perls.

Source amended to pass perlcritic. String evals removed or replaced.
Strictures added to module and examples. All filehandles are now
lexicals. Consistent source formatting applied to module (perltidy).

deny_uploads and set_size_limit added.

All active public subroutines are now methods.

print_cookie_data and print_form_data have been removed. They had been
deprecated for well over a decade.

escape_dangerous_chars has been removed. It has been considered a
security risk since version 2.0.
