CGI::Lite v2.04_03
----------------

Released: 8th Oct 2014


DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can use this module to decode form and query information, including file
uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner; you need not concern
yourself with the actual details behind the decoding process.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

Upload tests fixed again to solve problems for MSWin32 users:
binmode had been erroneously left off the inputs.

Fixed generation of MYMETA/META files as spec 2.0 not yet supported
in the local build environment.

See the CHANGES file for full history.
