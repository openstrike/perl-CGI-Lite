CGI::Lite v2.04_05
----------------

Released: 11th Oct 2014


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode form data, query strings, file uploads
and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has no dependencies and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

binmode forced on all file writes to avoid corruption when converting
EOLs on MSWin32.
