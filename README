CGI::Lite v2.04_01
----------------

Released: 6th Oct 2014


DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can use this module to decode form and query information, including file
uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner; you need not concern
yourself with the actual details behind the decoding process.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

Full test coverage of non-deprecated features.

BUG FIX: Multi-file uploads could break if the buffer end occured in the
    headers of one of the files. (issue 99294)

BUG FIX: $cgi->set_platform ('macintosh') erroneously set platform to
    'PC' because the regex was not anchored to the start. 'macintosh'
    now results in platform 'Mac' as it should.

Version control moved to git.

Makefile.PL extended to include resources (where available).
