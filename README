CGI::Lite v3.00_01
------------------

Released: 15th October 2015

This is a new release of the 3.x branch. Please be aware of the API
changes with particular reference to the deprecated and obsolete
subroutines and methods.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has no dependencies and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

These are the changes since the last release (3.00).

BUG FIX: Uploads with enctype "multipart/form-data" and at least one
    non-file param now process without warnings. (issue 107570)
