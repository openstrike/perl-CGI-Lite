CGI::Lite v3.00_02
------------------

Released: 27th November 2015

This is a new release of the 3.x branch. Please be aware of the API
changes with particular reference to the deprecated and obsolete
subroutines and methods.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has only one dependency and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

These are the changes since the last release (3.00_01).

Dual subs/methods have improved detection of how they have been called.

Misc small documentation improvements.

See the CHANGES file for full history.
