CGI::Lite v3.01
------------------

Released: 10th December 2015

This is a new release of the 3.x branch. Please be aware of the API
changes from 2.x with particular reference to the deprecated and obsolete
subroutines and methods.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has only one dependency and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

These are the changes since the last general release (3.00).

Dual subs/methods have improved detection of how they have been called.

BUG FIX: Uploads with enctype "multipart/form-data" and at least one
    non-file param now process without warnings. (issue 107570)

Misc small documentation improvements.

See the CHANGES file for full history.
