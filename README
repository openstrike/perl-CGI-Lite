new 3.0 branch. Please be aware of the API changes and report any bug
no matter how small or insignificant. Your assistance is greatly
appreciated.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has no dependencies and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

Uploaded files with duplicate field names are treated in the
same ways as other data with duplicate field names.
