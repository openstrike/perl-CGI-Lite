CGI::Lite v2.05
----------------

Released: 23rd Oct 2014


DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can use this module to decode form and query information, including file
uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner; you need not concern
yourself with the actual details behind the decoding process.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

Documentation improvements, Makefile.PL tweaks.

Changes since last stable release:

binmode forced on all file writes to avoid corruption when converting
EOLs on MSWin32.

Upload tests fixed again to solve problems for MSWin32 users:
binmode had been erroneously left off the inputs.

Fixed generation of MYMETA/META files as spec 2.0 not yet supported
in the local build environment.

Upload tests fixed to solve two problems for MSWin32 users:
permissions-based tests skipped and coversion algorithms for text MIME
types improved.

Full test coverage of non-deprecated features.

BUG FIX: Multi-file uploads could break if the buffer end occured in the
    headers of one of the files. (issue 99294)

BUG FIX: $cgi->set_platform ('macintosh') erroneously set platform to
    'PC' because the regex was not anchored to the start. 'macintosh'
    now results in platform 'Mac' as it should.

Version control moved to git.

Makefile.PL extended to include resources (where available).
